== Wavesplit ==

Wavesplit takes the monotony out of sampling, by automatically slicing
up a recording into one small file per event.

It takes a single 16-bit .wav file as an input and gives you several
shorter .wav files as the output.  Other than the input filename,
it can take two parameters: the threshold (get this loud to start
writing a new file, get quieter again to prepare to stop); and the
duration (stay quieter for this many samples in order to actually
stop).
