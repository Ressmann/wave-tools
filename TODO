== Things to do ==

=== All ===

* Filename extension matching should be truly case insensitive.  Make it lower case before performing the comparison.  That way, even .WaV, .waV, etc, will match.
* Make sure all programs are capable of batch processing

=== Makeamiga ===

* Allow command line specification of arbitrary --samplefrequency and --bitresolution, plus preset options like --tracker that do what it currently does (8-bit, 8363Hz).  Then rename the program to something more generic.

=== Makemono ===

* Have a command line argument to overwrite the original files

=== Wavesplit ===

* Rewrite the wave output for speed
* Accept multiple files as command line arguments
